# 🚀 100 Days of DSA in C (LeetCode)

This repository contains my 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenge, where I solve LeetCode problems using the C programming language. The purpose of this challenge is to build strong DSA fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, and maintain consistency through daily coding.

All solutions are written in C, with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and understanding time and space complexity. This repository serves as a learning log as well as a preparation resource for coding interviews, college exams, and competitive programming.

By solving at least one LeetCode problem every day, I aim to strengthen my logical thinking and gain confidence in tackling real interview-level questions.
